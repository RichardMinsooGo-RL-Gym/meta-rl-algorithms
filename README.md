# reinforcement-learning-algorithms
This repository contains code and material from different sources,

readings:
* [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)

Implementations:
* [OpenAI Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)

## Install requirements
~~The `requirements.txt` or conda environemnt `rl.yml` can be found in the root directory.~~ (Should be converted to an install script). For the installation of the OpenAI gym make sure to follow the [installation](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation) instructions.

## Available Algorithms (WIP)
A good global scope of different Reinforcement Learning algorithms can be found in: [RL Taxonomy](https://github.com/bennylp/RL-Taxonomy).
