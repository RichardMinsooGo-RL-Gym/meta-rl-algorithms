This repository contains code for exercises, solutions of the material from,
* [OpenAI Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)
* [Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
* [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
* [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)

## Install requirements
The `requirements.txt` or conda environemnt `rl.yml` can be found in the root directory. For the installation of the OpenAI gym make sure to follow the [installation](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation) instructions.

## Available Algorithms (WIP)
A good global scope of different Reinforcement Learning algorithms can be found in this repository, [RL Taxonomy](https://github.com/bennylp/RL-Taxonomy).
