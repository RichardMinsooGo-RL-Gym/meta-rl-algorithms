# Meta-Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This repository contains implementation and write-up of several algorithms for testing purposes.

## Install requirements
~~The `requirements.txt` or conda environemnt `rl.yml` can be found in the root directory.~~ (Should be converted to an install script). For the installation of the OpenAI gym make sure to follow the [installation](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation) instructions.
