## Temporal Difference (TD) methods

Implementation of Tabular (Double) Q-learning and (Expected) Sarsa on the Frozenlake environment. Of which the algorithms as described in the book of Barto & Sutton. The Q-learning and Sarsa algorithm and its variants perform similar the the environment, however the Expected Sarsa algorithm does not converge to a good Q-function on stochastic environments. Hence, the Q-learning algorithm, especially the Double Q-learning algorithm performs slightly better.
